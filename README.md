# Bulk Tasks

Bulk tasks provides an interface to delete, duplicate, export, import, move, and rename foundry documents en masse.

### Selection

The interface provides multiple ways to select documents.

- Clicking on either the document name or the checkbox will select it.
  - Clicking on folder names does not select the folder but instead expands it.
- Clicking a checkbox and then holding shift while selecting another checkbox selects all the documents in between those two documents.
- The "select all" button selects all documents of the given type.
- The "de-select all" button deselects all documents of the given type.
- Clicking a folder checkbox selects everything in the folder.

**For the last 3 points, performing them while in search mode only selects those that are currently visible.**

### Delete Documents

Allows for the deletion of documents across multiple document types including folders. Depending on the number of documents being deleted this may take a while. Keep a lookout for the job completed notification to pop up.
