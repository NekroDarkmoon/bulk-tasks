# Bulk Tasks

Delete/Move actors, journals, items, macros, scenes, tables, playlists en masse.

The module currently allows for users to delete multiple entity types at a single time, however the same isn't possible for the move functionality.

### Limitations
- Currently the move functionality is limited to one entity type at a time. If multiple entity types are selected the type with the highest count is only moved.
